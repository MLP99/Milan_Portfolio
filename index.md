# About me
Hello! My name is Milan Patty and I'm 21 years old. I am studying Information & Communication Technology at Fontys University of Applied Sciences in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. Currently, I'm in my 4th semester following a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. My previous semesters was in Business Informatics. I have a big passion for data and because of that, I'm very eager to learn more about data science and AI. I'm also active on Kaggle, Reddit, Quora and other platforms to talk about AI and data science.

# [Project 1: Festivate Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/MLP99/Festivate-EDA)
For this school project, my group members and I started a fictional company called Festivate to help fictional festival organizers to gain more insights from their data to help with decision making. In this project, I'm going to share my work. I designed the SQL database for this project for the festival organizers and used R to manipulate and visualize data.

* Designed a SQL database with 23 tables for the festival organizers
* Used SQL to write queries to gain insights about revenue, logistics, festivals and festival visitors
* Used R for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to modify and visualize data to extract insights

# [Project 2: New York City Property Sales Predictor](https://github.com/MLP99/NYC-PSP)
For this personal project, I built a machine learning model in Python that could predict prices for properties in New York City. The reason why I did this project is that I'm very interested in real estate and wanted to know more about this domain and learn more about machine learning. Besides the dataset about the properties, I'm using another dataset with demographic information about the NYC population and merged them to predict property prices.
This project is divided into 3 sections: [EDA](https://github.com/MLP99/NYC-PSP/blob/main/files/NYC_PSP_EDA.ipynb), [data preparation](https://github.com/MLP99/NYC-PSP/blob/main/files/NYC_PSP_PREPARATION.ipynb) and [model building](https://github.com/MLP99/NYC-PSP/blob/main/files/NYC_PSP_MODELLING.ipynb). I achieved the following things:

* Completed an Exploratory Data Analysis on the 80,000 properties in the dataset
* Built a machine learning model that could predict property prices in New York City
* Achieved a decrease of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) from the properties in the validation data by 48% (~ $92.400,00) by only using Feature Engineering
